# 🖥️ System Resource Monitor Script (Bash)

This is a lightweight Bash script that monitors CPU, Memory, and Disk usage on a Linux system. If any of the defined thresholds are exceeded, the script prints a warning to the terminal.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
sys_monitor.sh    # Main monitoring script
```

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 Checks current **CPU usage**
- 💾 Checks **RAM usage**
- 💽 Checks **Disk usage**
- 🚨 Prints a warning message if any usage exceeds defined thresholds

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The script defines thresholds for:

```bash
CPU_THRESHOLD=1
DISK_THRESHOLD=1
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=1
```

Each resource is checked with a separate function:

---

### 🔄 CPU Monitoring

```bash
cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
```

If current usage > threshold → prints:

```bash
High cpu usage : 32.5 %
```

---

### 🧠 Memory Monitoring

```bash
mem_usage=$(free | grep "Mem" | awk '{print $3/$2 * 100.0}')
```

If current usage > threshold → prints:

```bash
High memory usage : 76.8 %
```

---

### 💽 Disk Monitoring

```bash
disk_usage=$(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
```

If current usage > threshold → prints:

```bash
High disk usage : 89 %
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Make the script executable:**

```bash
chmod +x sys_monitor.sh
```

2. **Run the script manually:**

```bash
./sys_monitor.sh
```

⚠️ *This script is designed to run manually (not via cron). Useful for quick resource checks.*

---

## 🧪 Example Output

```txt
High cpu usage : 45.6 %
High memory usage : 83.2 %
High disk usage : 92 %
```

If system resources are below threshold → No output is shown.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Linux system with:
  - `top`
  - `free`
  - `df`
  - `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `bc`

These tools are available on most Linux distros by default.
